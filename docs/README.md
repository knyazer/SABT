# Documentation
There are generally two ways you can access documentation. 
First way is to build it by yourself, while second way is to simply access it 
from somewhere on the Internet. Will include the link in here somewhere in the future.

## Building docs from source
Install Python 3.8+ and pip, you can do that by following some tutorials on the internet.
Besides, you will need doxygen, which is also can be installed by following instructions on the Internet. 
Then you should install all the needed Python packages:

```python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt```

And after that, to finally build logs run:

```make html```
